      "The 24 Hours of Le Mans began in 1923 with a planned three-year format, including cumulative distances. However, this idea was dropped in 1928. The early years saw French, British, and Italian dominance, led by Bugatti, Bentley, and Alfa Romeo. Innovations, like aerodynamic designs, emerged in the late 1930s. General strikes and World War II led to a ten-year hiatus until the event resumed in 1949.",

Privateer constructors, including John Wyer's Mirage and Jean Rondeau's chassis, achieved notable wins in 1975 and 1980.",

Supercars, including McLaren's BMW V12-powered F1 GTR in 1995, exploited production rules. Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Nissan, Panoz, and Lotus entered GT categories. BMW's 1999 overall win marked the era's peak. The ACO's influence led to the American Le Mans Series in 1999, later merging into the United SportsCar Championship.",
